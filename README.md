# Simple Client / Server example for Node.js
 - server is in `server.js`
 - client is in `client.js`
 - service is on port 3024, this must be free
 - client sends a message to the server
 - server sends a message to the client
 - `message.js` exports received data handler (`Decoder.recv`) and message transmission (`send`) functions
 - messages are Buffers (arbitrary binary data)
 - the first byte of the message indicates how long it is
 - this means messages are between between (0,255) bytes long
 - `Decoder.recv` in `message.js` is very careful not to assume that each TCP packet is a single message, because that is only ever true on lightly-loaded dev boxes...
